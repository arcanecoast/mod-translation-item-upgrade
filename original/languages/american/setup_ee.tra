@127 = ~Assembled on behalf of <CHARNAME> using a dark and dire ritual, Teleomortis is a composite longbow of unparalleled power. When the string is drawn back a ghostly arrow forms, seeming to flicker and bend in the light. The bow thus requires no extra ammunition (although it can make use of more mundane arrows as well). The ghostly arrows associated with Teleomortis tear at the mind in some unknowable fashion, hinting at secrets not meant to be unearthed on this Plane.

Note: Avoid equipping normal arrows on your character, else the bow will fire these instead of the phantom arrows.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
– When no arrows are equipped, the bow fires missiles that are treated as +4 for the purposes of determining what enemies they can damage. The missiles receive +4 to hit, including the bonus listed below, and deal a total of 1d6+4 missile damage. A target struck by such an arrow has a 5% chance of being confused for 30 seconds.

@141 = ~Aeger's Hide +5
This heavy and thick bear hide is all that remains of the fabled Aeger. Several hundred years ago the Aeger, a giant bear, terrorized hundreds of small villages up and down the Sword Coast. The bear was invulnerable to fire, cold or acid. Finally the young men and women of several villages banded together, forming a militia almost two hundred people strong. The Aeger was surrounded and finally slain. Less than a dozen villagers survived, and they carved the Aeger's hide amongst themselves. Out of one of the pieces this armor was created.

More recently, <CHARNAME> arranged for Aeger's Hide to be improved with additional enchantments. It now provides a greater resistance to physical blows and elemental attacks.

STATISTICS:

@145 = ~Improved Firecam Full-Plate Armor
This suit of armor was originally designed for Keldorn and few others may wear it. The suit was later enchanted again at <CHARNAME>'s request and it now provides Keldorn with even more protection. While equipped the suit provides the wearer with a +2 bonus to all saving throws and grants the wearer with free action (able to pass through webs and other effects) and immunity to fear. Despite being incredibly strong, the armor is almost weightless.

@147 = ~Improved Ankheg Plate Mail
This plate mail has been expertly crafted. Sheathed in the chitinous scales of the ankheg, it provides a greater degree of protection than traditional plate mail and is not susceptible to rust. As any world-weary adventurer will tell you, however, the best appreciated aspect of ankheg mail is its light weight and low encumbrance. Monsters come and go but fatigue is a constant enemy.

This particular suit of Ankheg Plate Mail was reforged for <CHARNAME>. It now provides additional protection against melee and acid attacks and allows the wearer to mimic the acid-spitting attack of the Ankheg.

STATISTICS:

@149 = ~Shield of Harmony +3
Audn of the Field, Knight-Champion for the wizard Kekkim, carried this shield for most of his life. It protects the bearer from most forms of mind control, a benefit for a wizard who needed warrior allies to stay faithfully at his side. Both Kekkim and Audn have long since returned to the earth, leaving the shield to whomever might recover it from Kekkim's tower.

More recently the shield was re-enchanted by <CHARNAME>. It now provides extra physical defenses and makes the bearer immune to psionics (but not the intelligence drain of the Illithid).

@151 = ~Throwing Spear +3
One of man's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks sharpened at one end. When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel. This spear trembles from the powerful magic used in its creation.

Unlike almost every other spear you have encountered, this spear can be thrown. It was forged for <CHARNAME> with the help of a magical Rogue Stone. When thrown, the spear immediately returns to the hand of the wielder. (The spear may also be used as a melee weapon: select the second item ability to do so.)

STATISTICS:

@153 = ~Throwing Unicorn Spear +3
This graceful spear is carved to resemble the elongated horn of the unicorn. Wielders of this spear are immune to charm and hold spells, just as a unicorn might be. Whether the horn is or isn't an actual unicorn horn is the subject of much debate.

The original Unicorn Spear was reforged by <CHARNAME> to serve as a ranged weapon. When thrown, the spear immediately returns to the hand of the wielder. The immediacy of the return may explain how a throwing weapon can confer continuous effects on its wielder. Or maybe it's just magic. (The spear may also be used as a melee weapon: select the second item ability to do so.)

@155 = ~Throwing Impaler +4
The Impaler has a palpable aura of magic that hints at the vicious nature of the weapon and why it has been a favorite of several powerful orc chieftains in the past. When a victim is struck they are, as one would guess, very nearly impaled, run through as the massive enchantment does its dirty work.

After <CHARNAME> "liberated" the Impaler from the Sahuagin City-of-Caverns <PRO_HESHE> later had it reforged into a ranged weapon. When thrown, the spear immediately returns to the hand of the wielder. (The spear may also be used as a melee weapon: select the second item ability to do so.)

@157 = ~Staff of the Woodlands +5
Known only as the "Wild Man of the Wood", the man that carried this staff was a legendary figure near Trademeet until the day he died and returned to the soil. Those who saw him remember his dark, bark-like skin, a feature that would fade if the staff were set aside. He would harass irresponsible loggers and poachers, and old-timers tell of mercenaries chasing him with a dozen hunting dogs or more. The animals seemed ready to rip the poor druid to pieces, but he quickly turned them on their former masters. Rushing forward in hopes of ending his influence, the men-at-arms saw the final power of the staff, and as the vegetation trembled with the "Wild Man's" magical calling, there formed a green, rotting mix of life and death that shambled overtop of the terrified soldiers, killing them all.

Recently the Staff was re-enchanted by <CHARNAME> to give it slightly better melee abilities.

@159 = ~Sunblade: Daystar +4
Whether created specifically for use in the service of Torm or appropriated at some point in the long history of the church, Paladins of the Loyal Fury have made good use of Daystar in their battles against evil undead. Through magic or blessing it is empowered with the Sunray, a force of pure life energy so potent that it slays both living and unliving.

<CHARNAME> appropriated this blade from a Lich near the city gates of Athkatla and has since reforged it into an even more powerful instrument of holy justice.

@161 = ~Celestial Fury +5
To enchant a katana is no simple process. At least, that's what <CHARNAME> thought before <PRO_HESHE> first had it attempted on <PRO_HISHER> behalf. In reality, the most difficult part of reforging the already-godlike katana known as Celestial Fury was gathering the myriad ingredients required. Celestial Fury has served <CHARNAME> well since it was taken from the kensai Koshi in the Temple District of Athkatla. Its provenance before that point is as follows:

Many years ago, fierce tempests and fires ignited by lightning ravished the province administered by daimyo Hoshi Katahiroi. The daimyo's advisers, all respected wizards, soon divined that Nature was not to blame, but a powerful dragon of an unknown order. Some of the wise men suggested that the creature was an abomination; others believed that it was born of Primal Chaos before Kara-Tur was formed. All the advisers agreed to name it Celestial Fury.

Yet Daimyo Hoshi did not want to categorize the scourge of his province; he wanted to destroy it. He commissioned the famed Chigatta (a reclusive artisan, master of mystic arts), to construct a weapon that might sunder the dragon's spirit as well as cleave its scaled body. Chigatta's labors resulted in the finest katana imaginable, dubbed Celestial Fury after the beast it was fashioned to destroy, and enchanted with the power of flight.

With this weapon, Hoshi sought his province's bane among the storm clouds. Shouts and roars resounded through the heavens for days, and forked fire lit up the nights. At long last, Hoshi destroyed the dragon's body and trapped its spirit within his sword, merging the two Celestial Furies and impressing order over chaos. To finalize his victory, Hoshi had Chigatta fashion a scabbard from the dragon's hide and embed its magic pearl in the hilt.

Yet the dragon had its revenge. Hoshi was skilled in battle but weak of will. Celestial Fury's spirit took control of Hoshi, forcing him to slay Chigatta and then slay himself. The katana subsequently disappeared (most likely, Hoshi's grieving family discarded the traitorous weapon) and has perhaps changed many hands in the years since.

Celestial Fury is a katana of excellent construction -- a flexible but unbreakable blade of razor sharpness, a hilt covered with comfortable leather, and a huge pearl fixed at its end. The magical characters for Celestial Fury are inscribed on the blade, which glows pale violet and crackles with electricity when drawn. The sword is sheathed in a scabbard of dragon hide, the slate-grey scales of which constantly flash with streaks of silver, blue, and violet.

@165 = ~Hallowed Redeemer +5
Keldorn distinguished himself early in his career as a paladin, and received this blade as a boon from Torm. It is exceptionally accurate, but also protects him in battle with a special Fireshield, and any that strike him while he wields it suffer Torm's wrath in the form of magical damage. None but Keldorn may use this sword.

With <CHARNAME>'s help and the blessing of Torm, the sword was recently re-enchanted to become even more powerful.

@167 = ~Delryn Family Shield +4
This is Anomen's family shield, given to him by his father. In addition to the magical protection the shield radiates an aura that grants the wielder fire and cold resistance. To protect against ranged attacks, Anomen can use the shield to erect a field of energy. This protection from normal missiles can be used three times per day.

Recently <CHARNAME> had the shield strengthened with protective magics of the Saving Grace shield, recovered from the fading avatar of Amaunator, dramatically improving its raw defensive abilities.

@169 = ~Lilarcor +5
Lilarcor is not quite as lovable (or annoying, depending on your viewpoint) as it was before <CHARNAME> had it upgraded. When the Mind Flayer Control Circlet was embedded in its hilt, Lilarcor seemed to lose the ability to consciously converse with those nearby and was reduced to making occasional quips. However, Lilarcor's peculiar intelligence (or lack thereof) now serves as a boon (or a blight) to the wielder: the one holding Lilarcor cannot have its intelligence adjusted for any reason. This protects against the intelligence drain associated with the Illithid and the beneficial effects of a potion of Genius.

The powerful Soul Reaver blade has been reforged under the dark guidance of <CHARNAME>. The holy essence of Carsomyr was perverted to help create this abhorrent monstrosity. Soul Reaver is a tool of incredible power and incredible evil. Those who pick it up rarely put it down while still living.

Forged for <CHARNAME> by amalgamating the Bone Club and the splintered club Gnasher, The Fulcrum's powers lie in preserving balance.

In addition, the Club does additional damage against non-neutral opponents.

@179 = ~Gloves of the Master Thief: Twelve Fingers
<CHARNAME> had these gloves formed from a number of more mundane items that benefit the rogue. When these gloves are worn by a thief, each glove appears to have an extra magical finger that aids the fortune-hunter in performing their unique skills. In addition, the gloves are stylish. They look almost ... gnomish in design.

@183 = ~Water's Talon +4
The blade of this weapon seems to shimmer, revealing a fluid, razor-sharp edge shaped somewhat like the talon of a bird of prey. Water's Talon was commissioned by <CHARNAME> and holds vast power over damaging liquids. Each hit sucks some of the life out of the target and confers it to the wielder.  In addition, the water-like edge of the blade is forever envenomed. Much like one of its predecessors, Water's Talon provides immunity to charm. In addition, however, its mastery over water protects the user from the harmful effects of Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting. Most uniquely, the liquid nature of the blade allows it to extend and splash during combat, improving the strike range granted by the weapon to a range beyond that of most two-handed swords. This allows the wielder to make otherwise-impossible attacks from the back rows of a formation or try for daring hit-and-run tactics, counting on the poison from the first hit to disable foes.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Immunity to charm
– Immunity to domination
– Immunity to Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting
- Striking range is that of a spear or two-handed sword

Combat abilities:
– Target suffers 2 points of damage per second for 3 turns
– Wielder raises their maximum HP by 2 points for 3 turns on every hit

@185 = ~Azuredge +4
The already potent undead-bane Azuredge was further enhanced by <CHARNAME> when <PRO_HESHE> had it coated with a veneer of pure illithium. The axe first forged by Gulen Rockfire still returns to its wielder's hand when thrown and still smites undead with a holy fervor, but now it also protects the wielder from the level-draining assaults of the more powerful graveborn. On a more decorative note, the illithium seems to have shifted the color of the weapon slightly away from its namesake.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Immunity to level drain

Combat abilities:
– Returns to the wielder's hand when thrown
– Undead must save vs. Death at -4 or be utterly destroyed

@187 = ~Sorcerian Ring:  'Grasping Power'
This ring is undoubtedly the pinnacle of mnemonic lucubration. Crafted at <CHARNAME>'s request from rings of Wizardry, Acuity and Metaspell Influence Amulet it allows the bearer to memorize an extra spell each day for all spell levels from one to seven. In addition, a ring of protection has been melted into the band, providing minor physical and magical defenses.

@189 = ~Girdle of Glory
Created by <CHARNAME> to protect the wearer against slashing, piercing and blunt weapons, this belt is quite useful to anyone involved in a melee.  Its potent magic turns all types of offensive blows, and yet its slim form does not inhibit movement. In addition, the belt is stylish.

Equipped abilities:
– Armor Class: +3

@191 = ~Improved Kitthix Figurine
Reforged by <CHARNAME> to summon forth an even more powerful spider, the Kitthix figurine is no longer the last-ditch delaying tactic it once was. Gone are the days when Kitthix would be instructed to throw itself in front of a vastly superior foe in the hopes of momentarily distracting it. Kitthix's web-spinning and poisoning abilities have been upgraded, and the spider itself is less likely to be crushed by every passing foe.

STATISTICS:

Charge abilities:
– Summon Improved Kitthix once per day
  Range: 20 ft.
  Duration: 8 hours
  The spider can phase during combat. Kitthix's melee attack inflicts 2d4+2 damage (piercing) and occurs 4 times per round. Kitthix's attack is poisonous (Save vs. Poison at -3 negates), causing 5 points of poison damage per second for two rounds, and will also immobilize its target with a web (Save vs. Spell at -2 negates).
